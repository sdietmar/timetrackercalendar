**Me:** write python code that creates an event starting at the current system time and lasting 2 hours in a calendar using microsoft graph REST api

**ChatGPT:** Here is a sample Python code that creates an event starting at the current system time and lasting 2 hours in a Microsoft Calendar using the Microsoft Graph REST API:

```python
import requests
import datetime
import pytz

# Microsoft Graph endpoint for creating an event
endpoint = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/events"

# Access token for authentication
access_token = "your_access_token"

# Get the current system time
now = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.UTC)

# Set the start and end time for the event
start_time = now.isoformat()
end_time = (now + datetime.timedelta(hours=2)).isoformat()

# Event details
event = {
    "subject": "Sample event",
    "start": {
        "dateTime": start_time,
        "timeZone": "UTC"
    },
    "end": {
        "dateTime": end_time,
        "timeZone": "UTC"
    }
}

# Make a POST request to the Microsoft Graph API to create the event
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer " + access_token,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=event)

# Check the response status code
if response.status_code != 201:
    raise Exception("Failed to create event: " + response.text)

# Get the newly created event from the response
event = response.json()
print("Event created successfully:", event)
```

Note that you'll need to replace "your_access_token" with a valid access token for the Microsoft Graph API. Also, make sure to install the requests and pytz libraries if you don't already have them installed.

**Me:** write code that stores the previous created event in a  local json file. it needs to contain the event id.

**ChatGPT:** Here is an example of how you could store the previously created event in a local JSON file, including the event ID:

```python
import json

# Get the event details from the response
event = response.json()

# Save the event ID to a dictionary
event_data = {"event_id": event["id"]}

# Write the event data to a JSON file
with open("event.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(event_data, file)

print("Event data saved to event.json")
```

This code takes the event details from the response of the POST request to create the event and saves it to a dictionary that contains the event ID. The dictionary is then written to a local JSON file named event.json using the json.dump method.

---

**Me:** write code that reads the event id from the previoulsy created json file and get an updated calendar event from the microsoft graph rest api

**ChatGPT:** Here is an example of how you could read the event ID from the previously created JSON file and retrieve an updated calendar event using the Microsoft Graph REST API:

```python
import requests
import json

# Microsoft Graph endpoint for retrieving an event by ID
endpoint = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/events/{event_id}"

# Access token for authentication
access_token = "your_access_token"

# Load the event data from the JSON file
with open("event.json", "r") as file:
    event_data = json.load(file)

# Get the event ID from the loaded data
event_id = event_data["event_id"]

# Update the endpoint URL with the event ID
endpoint = endpoint.format(event_id=event_id)

# Make a GET request to the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve the event
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer " + access_token,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(endpoint, headers=headers)

# Check the response status code
if response.status_code != 200:
    raise Exception("Failed to retrieve event: " + response.text)

# Get the updated event from the response
event = response.json()
print("Event retrieved successfully:", event)
```

This code reads the event ID from the event.json file using the json.load method. It then updates the endpoint URL for retrieving an event by ID to include the event ID. A GET request is made to the Microsoft Graph API using the updated endpoint URL and the access token, and the updated event details are retrieved from the response. Note that you'll need to replace "your_access_token" with a valid access token for the Microsoft Graph API.

**Me:** change the code to read the access_token from a local text file called private_access_token

**ChatGPT:** Here is the updated code to read the access token from a local text file called private_access_token:

```python
import requests
import json

# Microsoft Graph endpoint for retrieving an event by ID
endpoint = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/events/{event_id}"

# Load the access token from the text file
with open("private_access_token.txt", "r") as file:
    access_token = file.read().strip()
```

In this updated code, the access token is loaded from the private_access_token.txt file using the open and read methods. The access token is stored in the file as a plain text string, and the strip method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces.

**Me:** create a PySimpleGUI popup that displays the event subject, the elapsed time since event start in hours and minutes and ask the user to input event body content.

**ChatGPT:** Here is an example of how you could create a PySimpleGUI popup that displays the event subject, the elapsed time since the event start in hours and minutes, and ask the user to input the event body content:

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg
import requests
import json
import datetime

# Calculate the elapsed time since the event start
start_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(event["start"]["dateTime"], "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ")
current_time = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)
elapsed_time = current_time - start_time
hours, remainder = divmod(int(elapsed_time.total_seconds()), 3600)
minutes, _ = divmod(remainder, 60)

# Create the PySimpleGUI popup
layout = [
    [sg.Text("Event Subject: " + event["subject"])],
    [sg.Text("Elapsed Time: {} hours {} minutes".format(hours, minutes))],
    [sg.Text("Event Body:", size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText("")],
    [sg.Button("Update Event"), sg.Button("Cancel")]
]

window = sg.Window("Update Event", layout)

# Show the popup and get the user input
while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    if event in (None, "Cancel"):
        break
    if event == "Update Event":
        # Make a PATCH request to the Microsoft Graph API to update the event
        body = {
            "body": {
                "content": values[0]
            }
        }

        response = requests.patch(endpoint, headers=headers, json=body)

        # Check the response status code
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception("Failed to update event: " + response.text)

        print("Event updated successfully")
        break

window.close()
```

**Me:** After user clicks "Update event", also update this events end time with current system time in same patch request.

**ChatGPT:** Here is the updated code that will update the end time of the event to the current system time when the user clicks the "Update Event" button:

```python
# Make a PATCH request to the Microsoft Graph API to update the event
body = {
    "body": {
        "content": values[0]
    },
    "end": {
        "dateTime": current_time.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ"),
        "timeZone": "UTC"
    }
}

response = requests.patch(endpoint, headers=headers, json=body)
```
(truncated answer again, so only the relevant changed code is shown)

**Me:** when creating the event, pass the subject as command line parameter

**ChatGPT:** Here's an updated version of the code that creates an event with the subject passed as a command line argument:

```python
import requests
import json
import sys
import datetime

# Get the event subject from the command line argument
subject = sys.argv[1]

# Get the current time
now = datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z'  # 'Z' indicates UTC time
```

**Me:** when creating the event, pass the subject as command line parameter

**ChatGPT:** Here's an updated version of the code that takes the event subject as a command line parameter:

```python
import requests
import sys
import json

def create_event(access_token, subject):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }

    # Get the current time
    current_time = int(time.time() * 1000)
    two_hours_later = current_time + 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000

    # Define the event data
    event_data = {
        "subject": subject,
        "start": {
            "dateTime": current_time,
            "timeZone": "UTC"
        },
        "end": {
            "dateTime": two_hours_later,
            "timeZone": "UTC"
        }
    }

    # Make the POST request to create the event
    response = requests.post('https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/events', headers=headers, data=json.dumps(event_data))

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 201:
        event = response.json()
        print(f'Event created with ID: {event["id"]}')
        return event["id"]
    else:
        print(f'Failed to create event: {response.text}')
        return None

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Read the access token from a file
    with open('private_access_token.txt', 'r') as f:
        access_token = f.read().strip()

    # Get the subject from the command line
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python create_event.py <subject>")
        sys.exit(1)
    subject = sys.argv[1]

    event_id = create_event(access_token, subject)
```

Now, when you run the script, you can pass the subject of the event as the first argument, for example:

```bash
python create_event.py "My Event Subject"
```

**Me:** how to get the local timezone?

**ChatGPT:** To get the local time zone in Python, you can use the pytz library and the datetime module.

```python
import datetime
import pytz

def get_local_timezone():
    tz = pytz.timezone(str(datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).astimezone().tzinfo))
    return tz

local_timezone = get_local_timezone()
print(local_timezone)
```

This code uses the datetime module to get the current UTC time, and then uses the astimezone method to convert the UTC time to the local time zone. The pytz.timezone method is then used to convert the time zone information to a string that can be used in the event data when creating the calendar event.
